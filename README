This is a research/future game which models evolution (through genetic algorithms) of population of animals. So far here are only grazers, but in the future I hope predators will appear as well. Future gameplay isn't clear now, it may be some kind of tower defence inside self-developing (through evolution) environment. The goal now is to create environment with animals whose behavior will be more and more complex during the time. So far it is necessary to get to know to which point it is possible to teach these animals to be logical and effective.
